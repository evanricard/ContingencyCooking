# Contigency Cookin'

## Getting Started

Welcome to Contingency Cookin'! (Name subject to change)
You know what they say, "If you can't handle the heat, get out of the kitchen!"
In this true test of culinary skill, we invite users to demonstrate their cooking prowess by recreating common recipes. 
The only catch is, we provide you with little to no information on a recipe and your challenge as a cuisine-connoisseur is to try 
to match your knowledge against ours!

### Cooking!
